# How Does it work 

As this is the Shell from a library all the shell does it either call the methods in quickTools or give the posibillty to  write your own code and give it to it for it to read it and execute the commands in given text 

It has a direct access to the shell by giving as an argument the word "shell" as an argument
from the terminal but you could just hit shell in the menu as well
