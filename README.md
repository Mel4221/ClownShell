 at the time it support a very limited amount of commands such as 
 1. cd
 2. cp
 3. mv
 4. ls
 5. ls-l
 6. ls disks
 7. ls *file extention
 8. rm or remove *don't required anythinng else it could literally remove a folder or a file  buf for the lovers of rm -r i added just in case 
 9. rm -r
 10. cat
 11. clear 
 12. touch
 13. echo *works but is not fullly supported yet  nor the magic of it
 14. du *thought it only prints the size of the file and it does it in auto as -h  Human
 15. mkdir
 16. find
 17. find -all *file extention like find -all *.pdf 
 18. disks
 
 > Must of this methods have another alias just to help a bit such as 
 1. rm as delete 
 2. touch as create
 3. ls as list-files or list
